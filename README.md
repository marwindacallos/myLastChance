This will show hints about the journey of myself becoming a programmer, will I stop or become successful at the end.

This is letter for myself, probably 10 years from now.
No matter what, you give your best of best but you still fail, but the thing is you never gave up, and that's what matter here, Whatever challenges you have you will get through it. Believe in yourself. Because that's what I'm doing now and that's how you get in there too. Think about points we had and connect it all from the start. Let's go my future self.
